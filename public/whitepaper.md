## 1. Introduction

In the beginning, there was Bitcoin. Then came Ethereum. Then 10,000 dog coins. And now, in the year of our lord 2024, we present to you: $CRUNCH.

### Problem Statement
- You have money
- You want less money
- Traditional finance is too slow at losing your money

### Solution
$CRUNCH - Lose money at the speed of light! 🚀

## 2. Tokenomics

**Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000,000 $CRUNCH (we like big numbers)

**Distribution**:
- 50% - Liquidity Pool (locked for 5 minutes)
- 20% - Dev wallet (for "marketing" aka lambos)
- 15% - Community airdrops (to pump our bags)
- 10% - Team tokens (vested over next Tuesday)
- 5% - Emergency rug fund (just kidding... unless?)

**Tax Structure**:
- 0% Buy tax (we're not monsters)
- 99% Sell tax (diamond hands only, paper hands get rekt)

## 3. Technology Stack

$CRUNCH utilizes state-of-the-art technology:

```
if (price < moon) {
    pump();
} else {
    pump_harder();
}
```

### Key Features:
- **Anti-Whale Mechanism**: Whales can only buy, never sell
- **Burn Function**: 1% of every transaction is sent to Vitalik's wallet by mistake
- **Staking Rewards**: Stake your $CRUNCH to receive more $CRUNCH (it's worthless either way)
